# Scavanging
To reduce costs and climate footprint, "scavanging" and repurposing of old electronics and other materials can be taken into acount.
The Following is what i might be able to use from my currently collected materials.

## Stored Stuff
- Water Pump from coffee maschine
- PC Fans for air circulation
- Heating Bars from old toaster 
- Power Cables from random maschines
- Cable chord (Kabeltrommel?) from vacuum cleaners
- 

## Custom 3D Printing
Since shipping is horrible and costly, printing custom parts on small scale is a good practice. Large parts like the water container are propably cost ineffectiv to print.
All the Connecter parts however are perfect for that and allow use/repurposing of all kind of materials that definetly werenÂ´t made for somethign like this.
