# Scavenging

To reduce costs and climate footprint, "scavenging" and repurposing of old electronics and other materials can be taken into account. The following is what I might be able to use from my currently collected materials.

## Stored Stuff
- Water pump from coffee machine
- PC fans for air circulation
- Heating bars from old toaster 
- Power cables from random machines
- Cable cord (Kabeltrommel?) from vacuum cleaners

## Custom 3D Printing
### Idea
Since shipping is horrible and costly, printing custom parts on a small scale is a good practice. Large parts like the water container are probably cost-ineffective to print. All the connector parts, however, are perfect for that and allow use/repurposing of all kinds of materials that definitely weren't made for something like this.

### Searching for a printer
