# Notes

## System types
### Difference Active-Passive System
Active:
- Air pumps for increased plant/root growth and less stale water.
- Water pumps for water circulation
Passive:
- No pumps
- Less moving parts --> Less expensive
- Way more labor intensive
- Risk of algae growth or root spoilage

### Difference Circulation-Non Circulating System
A circulating system constantly pumps water (in intervals) through the system, ensuring a steady stream of fresh water and oxygen for the roots. A non-circulating system fills up once and only changes water with the water change.

### Wick system
- Very old and simple
- Passive system (non-circulating)
- Capillary effect pulls the solution to the roots
- Limited water transfer --> Inefficient and low returns
- Plants:
  - Water-saving herbs
  
### Deepwater culture
- Simple 
- Passive system (non-circulating)
- High returns
- Roots are always (partly) submerged
- High risk of oxygen deprivation --> Air pump highly recommended
- Plants:
  - Leafy greens with low O² demand
  - NOT deep-rooting plants
  
### Ebb and flood system
- Active, (circulating)
- High returns
- Pump and valve periodically empty and fill the root area
- Getting the cycles right is tricky
- Good O² flow
- Plants:
  - Plants from dry and wet areas
  - Big, blooming plants (tomatoes, cucumbers)
  - Mediterranean herbs
  
### Drip system
- Active, (non-circulating but not always)
- Very water efficient
- Feeds plants using small tubes, excess is collected and reused
- Requires more tech but allows more control
- Plants:
  - Allows any kind but requires correct values
  
### Nutrient-film-system (NFT-System)
- Active, (circulating)
- Thin stream of solution flows down an angled pipe along the roots
- Efficient
- Plants die extremely fast when a malfunction happens
- Plants:
  - Salads and herbs
  - NOT heavy, strong rooting plants
  - Raspberries
  
### Aeroponic System
- Most modern of them all
- Active, (circulating)
- Roots are hanging freely and get sprayed with a solution mist
- High cost for high returns

## "Soil" types
Normally the soil would contain all the nutrients, in hydroponics it "only" fixes the plants in place and sometimes stores moisture. The nutrients are delivered through a solution containing clean water and (diluted) nutrients.

There are different demands for the substrate which no single substrate can fully fulfill:
- pH Value < 6.5
- High Capillarity
- High Air Capacity
- Low Salt Content
- High Water Capacity 
- High Structural Stability
- Good Re-wettability
- Suitable Nutrient Content
- Low Microbial Activity
- Free from Weeds and Pests

To save space and sanity, I will shorten some things. 
Water-Capacity: WC (Ability to store water)   
pH-Value: pH   
Air-Capacity: AC (Ability to store air/oxygen)   
Cation Exchange Capacity: CEC (Ability to store and give nutrients)
