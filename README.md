# Vertical-Garden-V2
Follow-up repo for my vertical garden project started in 2024.

## Current State of the project
Because of less then ideal work conditions during the first attempt of the project, it somewhat failed and couldnt be could not be continued at that time. Now, a different volunterr
has shown interest in the project and since my exam phase is almost over, I too have some more freetime to work on it now.

**Edit from February**
I had a complete system failure in both my devices so a lot of documents that I hadnt uploadet have been lost.

## Goal/ Project Phasers
