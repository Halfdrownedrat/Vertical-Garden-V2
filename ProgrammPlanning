# Writing/ Debugging
- Mostly using SSH connection
- Might need to do port forwarding if the other volunteer also wants access
- Hardware setup needs to be done localy

# Water Change
## Without Constant Sensor reading
- Everything done periodicly
- Valve gets power, lets water out
- Upper valve gets power, lets new solution in (storing the fresh water over the crops allows gravitiy to do the heavy lifting)
## With Sensor reading
- Valves get activated if values reach ceirtain constants

# Sensores
## pH

## Nutrient Concentration

## Temperature

## Moisture

# Envirement Controll
## Fan

## Heater


# Problems that need to be solved
- Limited amount of pins
- Extremly limited amounts of pins with 5V
- Cable managment is horrible
- Calibrating the sensores
- Incompatible Libraries eg.
- Power Drainage 
- Fire/ Flood Risk


# Data Logging
- Current Idea: Log Data using python --> Outsource task to minischfee or jago
## Colecting
- Collect every 1h
- Fetch Weather Data, time...

## Dataset
- Archive Data every 24h
